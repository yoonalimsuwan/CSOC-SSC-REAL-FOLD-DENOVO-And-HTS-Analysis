## What is CSOC-SSC?
A physically interpretable protein structure prediction framework combining:
1. **Controlled SOC (CSOC)** — learnable kernel K_α(r) = (r+ε)^{−α}·exp(−r/λ) that tunes SOC universality class
2. **Semantic-State Contraction (SSC v6)** — deterministic fixed-point operator (ε_FP=0.0028, σ→1)
3. **3-stage energy minimization** — bond + dihedral + tight distogram (tol=0.05Å) + clash removal
4. **DistogramNet** — multi-task neural network (36-bin distogram + Q3 + contact) trained on 862 AF2 structures
5. **HTS integration** — connects SOC burial states to cell-based ΔΔG stability landscape

## Project Narrative: V23 → V24 → V24.1

The CSOC‑SSC project started with the ambitious goal of building a **physically grounded, neural‑guided protein folding system** that could predict a protein’s Cα trace from its amino‑acid sequence alone – a true *de novo* folding engine. Early prototypes (V16–V22) introduced the core ideas: a neural encoder‑decoder, a learned per‑residue α‑field, an SOC interaction kernel, and RG multi‑scale refinement. However, they all suffered from silent bugs, missing physical constants, inconsistent energy scaling, and an SOC component that either crashed or had no influence on the dynamics.

The versions documented here mark the turning point where the code became scientifically rigorous and computationally dependable. They are presented as a continuous lineage, each release fixing the critical flaws of its predecessor while preserving the unique physics‑SOC‑RG philosophy.

### V23 — The Corrected Baseline

V23 was the first version that could run a full refinement cycle without crashing and without producing non‑physical energies. It addressed every known runtime and physics bug:

- **Missing geometry fields** (`ca_ca_dist`, `clash_radius`) were added to the configuration – previously these were referenced in the energy functions but never defined, causing immediate crashes.
- **Ramachandran energy double‑counting** was removed – the weight `w_rama` was applied both inside the function and again in the total energy aggregator, distorting the energy landscape.
- **SOC kernel numerical stability** was achieved by clamping distances to a minimum of 1.0 Å and using `exp(-a·log(D))` instead of `D**(-a)`. The kernel was also made batch‑safe by explicitly squeezing the batch dimension when present.
- **RG refinement** was fixed to safely trim the coordinate array to an exact multiple of the block size before reshaping, preventing silent truncation.
- **Avalanche stress computation** switched from the unreliable `coords.grad` (which could be `None` after AMP steps) to `torch.autograd.grad(loss, coords)`, guaranteeing a usable gradient signal.
- **Solvent energy** was vectorised using `torch.where`, eliminating a slow Python loop.
- **Backbone reconstruction** pre‑allocated a tensor for the O‑atom offset, avoiding repeated allocation inside the loop.

V23 became the rock‑solid foundation for all future work. It was strictly single‑process and used a vanilla Transformer encoder, but its physics were now trustworthy.

### V24 — Distributed & FlashAttention

With a correct physics baseline, V24 scaled the engine to high‑performance computing environments:

- **Multi‑GPU Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)** training was added using PyTorch’s `torch.distributed` and `DistributedSampler`. Training can now be launched with a simple `torchrun` command, and the code automatically handles device assignment, gradient synchronisation, and sampler epoch setting.
- **FlashAttention** was integrated via PyTorch 2.0’s `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel`, making the Transformer encoder much faster and more memory‑efficient without any change to the architecture.
- A **PDB fetcher** was included, allowing the engine to download structures directly from the RCSB by ID and use them as initial coordinates or native references for RMSD calculation.
- **Gradient accumulation** and mixed‑precision (AMP) were fully configured, enabling training with larger effective batch sizes across GPUs.

However, V24 still had two important gaps: the Transformer lacked any positional encoding (making it permutation‑invariant), and the SOC kernel was computed but never fed back into the energy function – it only served as a passive neighbour selector for avalanches. Training therefore struggled because the decoder’s zero‑centred output never matched the un‑centred targets, and the SOC dynamics had no driving force.

### V24.1 — Production‑Ready Release

V24.1 is the definitive, production‑grade version that closes every remaining loop:

- **Sinusoidal positional encoding** was added right after the embedding layer, giving the network true sequence‑order awareness. The encoder is no longer blind to residue position.
- **Target coordinates are centred** in the dataset and all input coordinates are centred before refinement, aligning with the decoder’s zero‑mean output. Training now converges properly.
- **SOC kernel energy** is now coupled into the total loss via a weak contact term: *E = –Kᵢⱼ·exp(–rᵢⱼ/8)*. This means the learned α‑field actively shapes the energy landscape through the SOC interaction, and the kernel influences both the energy and the avalanche propagation.
- **Neural restraint** is computed once at the beginning of refinement and reused, rather than re‑running the entire encoder‑decoder every step. This gives a major speed‑up for long simulations.
- **Avalanche dynamics** now use `coords.grad` after a standard `loss.backward()` – no more `retain_graph=True` or extra `autograd.grad` calls. The code is simpler and more robust.
- All the physics corrections from V23 and the distributed training capabilities of V24 are retained.

V24.1 is the engine we recommend for all new work. It is a single, self‑contained Python file, heavily commented, and ready for training on HPC clusters or refinement on a single GPU.

## Overall Architecture

The latest V24.1 architecture is summarised below:

```

Sequence → [Embedding + Sinusoidal Positional Encoding]
↓
[FlashAttention Encoder (6 layers)]
↓
Latent
/      
    [Geometry Decoder]   [Adaptive α Field]
Cα coords            α (per residue)

```




**Refinement loop** (per step):
1. Build SOC kernel *Kᵢⱼ = rᵢⱼ⁻⁽αᵢ⁺αⱼ⁾/² exp(–rᵢⱼ/λ)*.
2. Reconstruct backbone atoms (N, C, O) from the Cα trace using idealised peptide geometry.
3. Compute physical energies: bond, angle, Ramachandran, clash, hydrogen bond, electrostatics, solvation, rotamer packing, SOC contact, and α regularisation.
4. Optionally add a soft restraint to the neural prediction (computed once before the loop).
5. Backpropagate to populate `coords.grad`.
6. Optimiser step (Adam) + Langevin noise (temperature from CSOC).
7. Every 20 steps: SOC avalanche – residues with gradient stress above threshold push their top‑*k* neighbours through the kernel.
8. Every 200 steps: differentiable RG block‑averaging and upsampling.

- **CSOC criticality controller** – soft sigmoidal temperature based on structural instability σ.
- **Full physics energy stack**: bond, angle, Ramachandran, clash, hydrogen bond (angular), Debye‑Hückel electrostatics, burial‑based implicit solvent, approximate rotamer packing, and SOC contact.
