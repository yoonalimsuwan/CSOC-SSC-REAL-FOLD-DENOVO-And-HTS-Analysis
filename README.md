## What is CSOC-SSC?
A physically interpretable protein structure prediction framework combining:
1. **Controlled SOC (CSOC)** — learnable kernel K_α(r) = (r+ε)^{−α}·exp(−r/λ) that tunes SOC universality class
2. **Semantic-State Contraction (SSC v6)** — deterministic fixed-point operator (ε_FP=0.0028, σ→1)
3. **HTS integration** — connects SOC burial states to cell-based ΔΔG stability landscape

## Project Narrative: V23 → V24 → V24.1

The CSOC‑SSC project started with the ambitious goal of building a **physically grounded, neural‑guided protein folding system** that could predict a protein’s Cα trace from its amino‑acid sequence alone – a true *de novo* folding engine. Early prototypes (V16–V22) introduced the core ideas: a neural encoder‑decoder, a learned per‑residue α‑field, an SOC interaction kernel, and RG multi‑scale refinement. However, they all suffered from silent bugs, missing physical constants, inconsistent energy scaling, and an SOC component that either crashed or had no influence on the dynamics.

The versions documented here mark the turning point where the code became scientifically rigorous and computationally dependable. They are presented as a continuous lineage, each release fixing the critical flaws of its predecessor while preserving the unique physics‑SOC‑RG philosophy.

### V23 — The Corrected Baseline

V23 was the first version that could run a full refinement cycle without crashing and without producing non‑physical energies. It addressed every known runtime and physics bug:

- **Missing geometry fields** (`ca_ca_dist`, `clash_radius`) were added to the configuration – previously these were referenced in the energy functions but never defined, causing immediate crashes.
- **Ramachandran energy double‑counting** was removed – the weight `w_rama` was applied both inside the function and again in the total energy aggregator, distorting the energy landscape.
- **SOC kernel numerical stability** was achieved by clamping distances to a minimum of 1.0 Å and using `exp(-a·log(D))` instead of `D**(-a)`. The kernel was also made batch‑safe by explicitly squeezing the batch dimension when present.
- **RG refinement** was fixed to safely trim the coordinate array to an exact multiple of the block size before reshaping, preventing silent truncation.
- **Avalanche stress computation** switched from the unreliable `coords.grad` (which could be `None` after AMP steps) to `torch.autograd.grad(loss, coords)`, guaranteeing a usable gradient signal.
- **Solvent energy** was vectorised using `torch.where`, eliminating a slow Python loop.
- **Backbone reconstruction** pre‑allocated a tensor for the O‑atom offset, avoiding repeated allocation inside the loop.

V23 became the rock‑solid foundation for all future work. It was strictly single‑process and used a vanilla Transformer encoder, but its physics were now trustworthy.

### V24 — Distributed & FlashAttention

With a correct physics baseline, V24 scaled the engine to high‑performance computing environments:

- **Multi‑GPU Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)** training was added using PyTorch’s `torch.distributed` and `DistributedSampler`. Training can now be launched with a simple `torchrun` command, and the code automatically handles device assignment, gradient synchronisation, and sampler epoch setting.
- **FlashAttention** was integrated via PyTorch 2.0’s `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel`, making the Transformer encoder much faster and more memory‑efficient without any change to the architecture.
- A **PDB fetcher** was included, allowing the engine to download structures directly from the RCSB by ID and use them as initial coordinates or native references for RMSD calculation.
- **Gradient accumulation** and mixed‑precision (AMP) were fully configured, enabling training with larger effective batch sizes across GPUs.

However, V24 still had two important gaps: the Transformer lacked any positional encoding (making it permutation‑invariant), and the SOC kernel was computed but never fed back into the energy function – it only served as a passive neighbour selector for avalanches. Training therefore struggled because the decoder’s zero‑centred output never matched the un‑centred targets, and the SOC dynamics had no driving force.

### V24.1 — Production‑Ready Release

V24.1 is the definitive, production‑grade version that closes every remaining loop:

- **Sinusoidal positional encoding** was added right after the embedding layer, giving the network true sequence‑order awareness. The encoder is no longer blind to residue position.
- **Target coordinates are centred** in the dataset and all input coordinates are centred before refinement, aligning with the decoder’s zero‑mean output. Training now converges properly.
- **SOC kernel energy** is now coupled into the total loss via a weak contact term: *E = –Kᵢⱼ·exp(–rᵢⱼ/8)*. This means the learned α‑field actively shapes the energy landscape through the SOC interaction, and the kernel influences both the energy and the avalanche propagation.
- **Neural restraint** is computed once at the beginning of refinement and reused, rather than re‑running the entire encoder‑decoder every step. This gives a major speed‑up for long simulations.
- **Avalanche dynamics** now use `coords.grad` after a standard `loss.backward()` – no more `retain_graph=True` or extra `autograd.grad` calls. The code is simpler and more robust.
- All the physics corrections from V23 and the distributed training capabilities of V24 are retained.

V24.1 is the engine we recommend for all new work. It is a single, self‑contained Python file, heavily commented, and ready for training on HPC clusters or refinement on a single GPU.

## Overall Architecture

The latest V24.1 architecture is summarised below:

```

↓
[FlashAttention Encoder (6 layers)]
↓
Latent
/      
    [Geometry Decoder]   [Adaptive α Field]
Cα coords            α (per residue)

```




**Refinement loop** (per step):
1. Build SOC kernel *Kᵢⱼ = rᵢⱼ⁻⁽αᵢ⁺αⱼ⁾/² exp(–rᵢⱼ/λ)*.
2. Reconstruct backbone atoms (N, C, O) from the Cα trace using idealised peptide geometry.
3. Compute physical energies: bond, angle, Ramachandran, clash, hydrogen bond, electrostatics, solvation, rotamer packing, SOC contact, and α regularisation.
4. Optionally add a soft restraint to the neural prediction (computed once before the loop).
5. Backpropagate to populate `coords.grad`.
6. Optimiser step (Adam) + Langevin noise (temperature from CSOC).
7. Every 20 steps: SOC avalanche – residues with gradient stress above threshold push their top‑*k* neighbours through the kernel.
8. Every 200 steps: differentiable RG block‑averaging and upsampling.

## Project Narrative: V25.5 → V26

The CSOC‑SSC project reached a research‑grade milestone with **V25.5**, which introduced two critical innovations: a sparse SOC neighbour graph (replacing the O(N²) dense kernel) and a fully differentiable avalanche loss. These changes made the engine scalable to realistic protein lengths (>500 residues) and allowed the SOC dynamics to be trained end‑to‑end. However, V25.5 still relied on a CPU kd‑tree for graph construction and contained a few Python loops that limited GPU throughput.

**V26** takes the final step toward a production‑grade, HPC‑ready folding engine. Every operation now runs on the GPU without CPU synchronisation. The sparse graph is built via `torch.cdist` and thresholding, the avalanche loss is completely vectorized, and the rotamer energy is computed using the same sparse edges. The result is a **fully GPU‑native, fully differentiable, scalable** folding engine that preserves all the physics, SOC, and RG features of its predecessors.

---

Physics Energy Terms (V26)

All energies are computed on the reconstructed backbone atoms (N, C, O) from the Cα trace using idealised peptide geometry. The α‑field modulates many local terms, acting as a universality‑class controller – low α makes a residue stiff, high α makes it flexible.

Term Description α‑Modulation
Bond ((d – d_target)²) , d_target = 3.8·(1 + α_mod·(α–1)) Target length
Angle ((cos θ – cos θ_target)²) , θ_target = 110°·(1 + α_mod·(α–1)) Target angle
Ramachandran ((φ–φ₀)² + (ψ–ψ₀)²) / width_eff² , width_eff = width·(1 + α_mod·(α–1)) Allowed width
Clash ReLU(radius – r)² , radius = 3.5·(1 + α_mod·(α–1)) Clash radius
H‑bond –alignment · exp(–((d – d_ideal)/0.3)²) , d_ideal = 2.9·(1 + α_mod·(α–1)) Ideal distance
Electrostatics q_i q_j exp(–κ r) / (ε r) (Debye‑Hückel, κ=0.1, ε=80) None
Solvation Hydrophobic penalty when exposed; hydrophilic penalty when buried None
Rotamer (sparse) Penalty for Cβ clashing with neighbouring Cα atoms, computed only on sparse graph edges None
SOC Contact (sparse) –K_ij · exp(–r_ij/8) – couples the SOC kernel to distances, computed only on sparse edges Kernel depends on α
Avalanche (vectorized) Weighted sum of –K_edge * (coords[dst] · direction[src]) for stressed residues Kernel depends on α
α Regularisation Entropy + spatial smoothness of the α field –

All weights are configurable in the V26Config dataclass.

---

SOC Dynamics & Criticality

· Sparse SOC kernel: K = r^(-α_ij) * exp(–r/λ) computed only for residue pairs within sparse_cutoff (default 12 Å). This reduces complexity from O(N²) to O(E).
· σ (avalanche intensity): Mean displacement of Cα positions since last step.
· Temperature: Soft sigmoid: T = T_base + 2000 · sigmoid((σ – σ_target)/0.5) – no hard clamps.
· Langevin noise: Added to coordinates after each gradient step, scaled by √(2·friction·T/T_base) * lr.
· Avalanche loss: Residues with gradient norm > threshold contribute a loss that pushes their top neighbours (selected by kernel weight) along the negative gradient direction. Fully vectorized on GPU.

---

Renormalisation Group (RG) Refinement

Every rg_interval (default 200) steps, the Cα chain is coarse‑grained by average pooling (F.avg_pool1d, factor=4) and then linearly interpolated back to the original length. This differentiable operation encourages multi‑scale consistency.

---

Dataset Format (for Training)

Provide a list of (sequence, coordinates) tuples. Coordinates must be centred (zero mean) because the decoder output is zero‑centred. Example:

```python
data = [
    ("ACDEF...", np.array([[x1,y1,z1], ...], dtype=np.float32) - mean),
    ...
]
```

The included ProteinDataset expects such a list. For production, replace the synthetic generator with a PDB‑parsing pipeline that extracts Cα atoms, centres them, and maps three‑letter codes to one‑letter codes.

---

Performance Tips (V26)

· GPU: At least 8 GB VRAM recommended for proteins up to 500 residues.
· Scaling: The sparse graph builder is O(N²) only for the initial cdist step, but thresholding and edge selection are O(N²) as well – for N > 2000 you may want to increase the graph rebuild interval or use a larger cutoff.
· Graph rebuild: Adjust rebuild_interval (default 100) to balance accuracy and speed.
· AMP: Enabled by default for ~2× speedup.
· Real data: The synthetic dataset is only a demo. Train on a non‑redundant set of PDB chains (≥10 000) for meaningful results.

---

Version History

V25.5 — Sparse SOC + Differentiable Avalanche

· Replaced explicit coordinate mutation with a differentiable avalanche loss that pushes neighbours via gradient direction.
· Fixed RG refinement using F.avg_pool1d and F.interpolate.
· Kept CPU kd‑tree for graph building and a few Python loops in avalanche/rotamer energies.

V26 — Fully GPU‑Vectorized Engine

· Sparse graph builder now runs entirely on GPU via torch.cdist and thresholding – no CPU synchronisation.
· Avalanche loss is fully vectorized using tensor indexing and scatter operations – no Python loops.
· Rotamer energy uses the sparse edges, reducing cost from O(L²) to O(E).

## CSOC-SSC v27 & v28 — Physics-Guided Refinement Engines for Next-Generation Protein Folding

### 🧬 The Missing Piece in AlphaFold’s Puzzle

While AlphaFold 3 (AF3) and similar deep-learning models produce stunning protein structure predictions, they remain fundamentally probabilistic and can generate physically unrealistic structures — steric clashes, unphysical torsion angles, unstable energy minima, and a heavy reliance on evolutionary information (MSAs). For *de novo* designed proteins, orphan sequences, or high-stakes drug discovery, these limitations become critical.

**CSOC‑SSC v27 and v28 are deterministic, GPU‑native, physics‑based refinement engines that close this gap.** They act as the “physics stamp” that validates and corrects any initial structure — whether from AF3, other AI predictors, or even random starting points — ensuring it obeys true physical laws and achieves chemical stability.

### 🌟 V28 — Monolithic Multi‑GPU Multimer Folding Engine with Equivariant Geometry

V28 is a **monolithic architecture** designed for large‑scale applications: it supports **multiple protein chains (multimers)** natively, employs an **E(n)‑equivariant graph decoder (EGNN)** for rotation‑ and translation‑invariant structure prediction, and runs seamlessly on **multi‑GPU HPC clusters** via PyTorch’s native Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).

#### ✨ What’s New in V28

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Multimer support** | Accepts multiple sequences (chains); builds a single sparse graph including inter‑chain interactions. |
| **Inter‑chain energy** | LJ, Coulomb, and a chain‑break penalty keep chains in realistic proximity. |
| **Equivariant EGNN decoder** | Predicts 3D coordinates from latent embeddings while being exactly rotation‑ and translation‑equivariant — faster and more robust than MLP‑only decoders. |
| **Monolithic DDP** | The entire model is a single `nn.Module` that can be wrapped with `DistributedDataParallel` for multi‑GPU training and refinement. |
| **All V27 physics** | Retains full‑atom force‑field (LJ, Coulomb, torsion), SOC criticality, avalanche loss, and backbone energies. |

# CSOC‑SSC HTS FOLD v28 — High‑Throughput Mutational Scanning & Epistasis Analyzer

### 🔬 From Stability Landscapes to Physics‑Guided Mutagenesis

**HTS FOLD v28** is the companion analytical engine for the CSOC‑SSC protein folding suite.  
It processes experimental **ΔΔG stability landscapes**, detects **epistatic couplings**,  
correlates mutational effects with **evolutionary (GEMME) scores**, and — when coupled with  
a CSOC‑SSC refined structure — can perform **structure‑based in silico saturation mutagenesis**.

Built for large‑scale screening datasets, it handles **multiple independent files** (CSV, ZIP,  
directories) and optionally accelerates statistical tests on **GPU**.

---

### ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi‑source data loader** | Reads single CSV, ZIP archives, or entire directories of data tables. |
| **ΔΔG statistical profiling** | Aggregates mean, median, quartiles, and distributions across all samples. |
| **Epistasis detection** | Identifies double‑mutant pairs with |ε| > threshold, computes significance. |
| **GEMME–ΔΔG correlation** | Quantifies how well evolutionary constraint predicts experimental ΔΔG (Pearson & Spearman). |
| **GPU‑accelerated calculations** | Uses CuPy for correlation on very large datasets (optional). |
| **Publication‑ready visualisation** | Histograms, scatter plots, bar charts with seaborn styling, high DPI. |
| **Structure‑based ΔΔG prediction** | (Integration mode) Uses a CSOC‑SSC refined PDB to compute mutational energy differences. |
| **JSON report export** | All statistics and results saved for downstream analysis. |

🔗 Integration with CSOC‑SSC Folding Engine

HTS FOLD v28 is designed to work hand‑in‑hand with CSOC‑SSC v27/v28:

1. Obtain an initial structure (e.g., from AlphaFold, or use CSOC‑SSC stand‑alone prediction).
2. Refine the structure using csoc_v28.py refine ... — this produces a physically stable full‑atom PDB.
3. Feed that PDB into HTS FOLD via --pdb refined.pdb. The engine can then compute ΔΔG for any mutation found in your screening data by evaluating the CSOC‑SSC energy function for wild‑type and mutant.

This creates a fully closed‑loop mutagenesis platform — from sequence to stability prediction — without relying on external web services.

🚀 Usage

1. Train the V30 Model (Real PDB Data)

```bash
python csoc_v30.py train --pdb_dir /path/to/pdb_directory --epochs 100 --batch_size 8
```

The directory should contain .pdb files. The model will be saved in ./v30_ckpt/v30_pretrained.pt.

2. Refine a Protein Structure

```bash
python csoc_v30.py refine --pdb 1abc --out refined_1abc.pdb --steps 600
```

Or provide a sequence and initial CA coordinates:

```bash
python csoc_v30.py refine --seq MKFLILFNILV --init init.pdb --out refined.pdb
```

Use --num_replicas 4 to run four parallel refinements on 4 GPUs and keep the best.

3. Run HTS FOLD v31 – Full Mutational Scan

```bash
python hts_fold_v31.py --pdb refined_1abc.pdb --scan --relax_steps 20 --gpu --output ./hts_output
```

· --scan enables full single‑mutation scanning (all 20 amino acids at every position)
· --relax_steps 20 performs 20 optimisation steps per mutant (set to 0 for quick approximation)
· --num_gpus 4 to parallelise the scan across 4 GPUs
· Use --chain A to select a specific chain from a multimer

4. Scan Specific Mutations Only

```bash
python hts_fold_v31.py --pdb refined.pdb --mutations 30F 45A 72W --gpu
```

5. Combine with External ddG / Epistasis Data

```bash
python hts_fold_v31.py --data ./my_ddg_files/ --pdb refined.pdb --scan --output ./analysis
```

This will additionally compute ΔΔG statistics, epistasis distributions, and GEMME correlations from your CSV/ZIP files.
