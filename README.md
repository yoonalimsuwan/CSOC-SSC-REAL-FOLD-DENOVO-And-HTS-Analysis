## What is CSOC-SSC?
A physically interpretable protein structure prediction framework combining:
1. **Controlled SOC (CSOC)** — learnable kernel K_α(r) = (r+ε)^{−α}·exp(−r/λ) that tunes SOC universality class
2. **Semantic-State Contraction (SSC v6)** — deterministic fixed-point operator (ε_FP=0.0028, σ→1)
3. **3-stage energy minimization** — bond + dihedral + tight distogram (tol=0.05Å) + clash removal
4. **DistogramNet** — multi-task neural network (36-bin distogram + Q3 + contact) trained on 862 AF2 structures
5. **HTS integration** — connects SOC burial states to cell-based ΔΔG stability landscape

# CSOC-SSC v12.4
## Multiscale Criticality-Guided Biomolecular Folding Engine

---

## Overview

CSOC-SSC v12.4 is a hybrid AI + physics biomolecular folding framework designed for:

- De novo protein folding
- SOC/RG-inspired structural emergence
- Criticality-guided optimization
- Differentiable biomolecular physics
- Large-scale multiscale folding research

Unlike conventional black-box folding systems, CSOC-SSC focuses on:

- Interpretability
- Statistical mechanics
- Self-organized criticality (SOC)
- Renormalization-group (RG) dynamics
- Physics-informed optimization

This framework is NOT intended as a direct AlphaFold replacement.

Instead, it is a research-oriented folding engine exploring how:

- Criticality
- Adaptive universality classes
- Information diffusion
- Geometric emergence

can drive biomolecular structure formation.

---

# Core Architecture

CSOC-SSC v12.4 uses a hierarchical 4-layer architecture:

```text
Sequence
    ↓
Layer 1 — Biological Priors
    ↓
Layer 2 — SOC / SSC Dynamics
    ↓
Layer 3 — Differentiable Physics
    ↓
Layer 4 — Multiscale RG Refinement
    ↓
Final 3D Structure
```

---

# Major Features

## 1. Adaptive Universality Classes

Each residue receives its own learnable critical exponent:

```math
K(r) = r^{-\alpha} e^{-r/\lambda}
```

where:

- α is residue-specific
- α is dynamically predicted
- universality classes can vary across the same protein

This allows:

- long-range critical communication
- local structural specialization
- multifractal folding behavior

---

## 2. Contact Diffusion Dynamics

The framework introduces contact-driven latent diffusion:

```math
H' = K H
```

where:

- H is latent residue state
- K is SOC kernel matrix

This acts as an information propagation mechanism between:

- geometry
- latent chemistry
- folding dynamics

---

## 3. SOC / SSC Criticality Engine

CSOC-SSC continuously estimates system criticality:

```math
\sigma \sim 1
```

where:

- σ < 1 → subcritical
- σ > 1 → supercritical
- σ ≈ 1 → critical regime

The system dynamically adjusts temperature using:

```math
T_{dynamic} \propto |\sigma - 1|
```

This creates:

- adaptive exploration
- self-correcting dynamics
- critical-state stabilization

---

## 4. Dynamic Langevin Thermostat

Instead of standard optimization only, v12.4 uses:

- stochastic Langevin refinement
- criticality-aware noise injection
- adaptive thermal fluctuations

This helps escape:

- local minima
- folding traps
- metastable conformations

---

## 5. Sparse GPU Physics

The framework supports:

- sparse contact graphs
- KD-tree neighbor search
- reduced GPU memory usage
- large-scale residue systems

Optimized for:

- Colab T4
- A100
- CUDA mixed precision

---

## 6. RG Multiscale Refinement

CSOC-SSC performs recursive coarse-to-fine refinement:

```text
Fine → Coarse → Refined → Upsampled
```

using:

- RG-inspired hierarchy
- cubic spline reconstruction
- geometric smoothing

This improves:

- stability
- convergence
- multiscale consistency

---

# Physics Components

The differentiable physics engine includes:

- Bond constraints
- Clash avoidance
- Contact energies
- SASA approximation
- Hydrophobic collapse
- Criticality regularization

---

# Key Differences from Conventional AI Folding

| Feature | AlphaFold-style | CSOC-SSC |
|---|---|---|
| Black-box AI | High | Low |
| Physics Interpretability | Limited | Strong |
| SOC Dynamics | No | Yes |
| RG Multiscale Dynamics | No | Yes |
| Criticality Control | No | Yes |
| Adaptive Universality Classes | No | Yes |
| Langevin Thermostat | No | Yes |
| Folding Emergence Focus | Limited | Core Principle |

---

# Computational Philosophy

CSOC-SSC treats protein folding as:

> an emergent critical phenomenon governed by geometry, information diffusion, and statistical mechanics.

Rather than purely fitting structures from data, the framework investigates:

- structural emergence
- universality tuning
- adaptive criticality
- self-organized folding dynamics

---

# Training Status

v12.4 supports both:

## Physics-Only Mode
No training required.

The framework can already perform:

- geometry optimization
- SOC-driven refinement
- folding exploration

using handcrafted differentiable physics.

---

## Hybrid Learning Mode
Optional supervised learning can be added using:

- PDB datasets
- distogram losses
- torsion losses
- RMSD supervision
- criticality regularization

Example:

```python
L_total =
    L_distogram
    + L_contact
    + L_torsion
    + L_rmsd
    + lambda_crit * (sigma - 1.0)**2
```

---

# Hardware Recommendations

## Google Colab T4

Recommended limits:

| System Size | Recommended |
|---|---|
| 100–500 residues | Excellent |
| 500–1500 residues | Good |
| 1500–5000 residues | Requires optimization |
| 10k+ residues | Use sparse batching |
